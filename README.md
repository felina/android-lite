Felina-AndroidLite
==================

A simpler version of the Felina android app, designed to be used by less tech-savy users in remote locations(Robben Island, South Africa).
The primary functionality of the app is to:
* Automatically authenticate with the server using a system of UUIDs which have been verified by a researcher-level account.
* Upload images taken using the simplified point-and-click interface, to the server.
* Queue images if an internet connection is not available.
* Start uploading queued images when a connection is established.
* Lock-up and prevent users from uploading further images upon receiving the command from the server.
